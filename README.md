# FIFO-DESIGN

# Project Title: FIFO Design and Implementation Using Verilog

## Project Overview:
The FIFO Design and Implementation project aimed to create a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data buffering system using the Verilog hardware description language. The project's objective was to develop a functional and efficient FIFO design that could handle data transfer between different clock domains while adhering to the FIFO principle of preserving data order.

## Project Objectives:

- Design a FIFO module using Verilog that supports simultaneous write (enqueue) and read (dequeue) operations.
- Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure proper data transfer between clock domains.
- Create a simulation environment to validate the functionality and performance of the FIFO design.
- Generate a block diagram to visually represent the FIFO architecture and data flow.
